# Get your code to build your own iso

	git clone https://github.com/PeterDauwe/twist-leftwm


# Use the installation-scripts  in a terminal of your choice
	- 30-build-the-iso-the-first-time.sh will build a Arcolinux-Leftwm as is. Nothing edited.

	- 230-personalized-build-the-iso-timed.sh will build a Arcolinux-Leftwm as is, but... 
		a) the content of personalsoftware.x86_64 will be added to the iso.
		b) the name of the iso will be changed to Twist-Leftwm


# After the installation of a 230-personalized-build-the-iso.
	Typ in a terminal : personal (this will copy a .bashrc-personal and a .zsh-personal to your system)

	On reload typ in a terminal : custom (this will set all icons, themes, and settings of twist-leftwm in place)

	To undo this : typ in a terminal : standard and you will have the Arcolinux-Leftwm settings again


Hope you like this, it was fun to make.
